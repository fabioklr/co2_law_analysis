Le Temps, 01.06.2021 Andr Schneider: Carbon neutral in 2050 is a challenge for all aviation, everyone has to do their part Fleet renewal, development of the alternative fuel market: the approach of the CO2 law, the Swiss aviation sector presents its solutions.Andr Schneider, General Manager of Genve Aroport, believes that the sector has the cards in hand to achieve this goal Etienne Meyer- A few days before the vote on the revision of the CO2 law on June 13, which provides for the introduction of a tax on plane tickets, the aviation sector presents its roadmap to achieve carbon neutrality.This document is the result of work involving air, aroport, high-coles and the Federal Civil Aviation Office (OFAC) and the Federal Office for the Environment (OFEV) the Aviation Research Center Switzerland (ARCS) initiative.For Andr Schneider, General Manager of Genve Aroport, and chairman of this working group, this study provides evidence that aviation has the solutions to achieve the net mission in 2050 in line with the objectives of the Federal Council's climate strategy.Time: Is this roadmap an answer to the tax on airline tickets provided by the CO2 law?Andr Schneider: We wanted to respond to discussions about aviation in general, not specifically the CO2 law.There have been a lot of discussions around aviation, and the final point is that the only option to decarbonize the sector is to reduce the number of flights.We wanted to show that lon can maintain our offer by dcarbonizing flights.We live in a globalised world, people will not stop overnight from flying to visit their families, in Portugal for example, by driving 24 hours.This tude foresees an increase in the number of Cointrin passengers in the coming decades.Is it compatible with mission reduction?There are three scripts.In the highest case, we would reach 25 million passengers in 2040, but the most likely hypothsis we believe is to reach 21 million.This is a relatively small increase given that we are already 18 million before the Pandmy.For Genve, the objective of the net zro is achievable with this increase.It should also be stressed that it is not for us, with these passenger scenarios, to achieve a goal but to project a plan for our infrastructures.In order to achieve the net zro in aviation, do not the efforts concern the airlines more than the aroports?The companies have done a lot because the aroports have taken a little lead in this area.Today, for example, the buildings of the Genve port built these last five years produce more energy than they consume.We also transform the traffic on the tarmac by going towards a electric motorization.But we must also recognize that it is easier for us.However, these last few years, the companies have reduced passenger transport missions.It cannot be said that this is only the problem of companies or aroports.This is a challenge that concerns the whole industry and everyone has to do their part.We are trying to help companies in this direction with an incentive program.Some of the taxes paid by us are paid to them if they renew their fleet with aircraft of last gnration, less greedy in krosne and less noisy.According to the road map, much of the reduction in missions is mainly based on the use of alternative fuels.Everything depends on the temporality in which we place ourselves since the objectives run until 2050.Fleet renewal is also an essential point, since the new aircraft generation reduces CO2 missions and fuel consumption by up to 20%.But when we know that an airplane rated between 100,200 million francs, it won't happen in Limmdiat.In a first phase, from 2025-2040, biofuels and flight management optimization measures will play a major role.In the year 2040, this is the horizon to which we could see aircraft appearing with new engines.But these technologies should still be merger dcennias.Manufacturers like Airbus are working on it, so these technologies will end up merger.We have an upstream work to do in this perspective.Let's imagine that lon has electric planes that have 45minutes between their arrival and departure.We're going to have to put infrastructure in place so that we can recharge them in this period of time.From the point of view of alternative fuels, there is a whole preparation for their storage.In Genve, we had a project in this direction which has not been achieved, but we therefore have an idea of what this represents.If these technologies are available faster, we will re-evaluate the objectives.For the development of alternative fuels, the study suggests that international solutions should be privileged.Can these capacities not be developed in Switzerland?The investment necessary for their industrial development is only possible at the level of large groups.Lintrt of this report is also to show that Switzerland can take matters into its own hands and that we must stop being a small Gallic village and doing things in our own corner.For synth fuels, we have research groups that advance on different solutions, but probably not the resources to produce them.For example, for the production of krosne via solar, huge fields of solar panels would be required.When I see the difficulty of installing it in Switzerland, it's not here that we're going to do it.One of the other solutions highlighted is to work on the optimization of flights.Can CO2 missions still be reduced in this respect?Yes, it goes through more efficient flight routes or less greedy landing and take-off methods.For example, one can imagine no longer using the jets for displacement prior to collapsing or after landing using alternative electric motors.In Genve, this is not really possible because it takes today fifteen minutes of heating for the jets to take off.At the airport, there is no parking space from which the aircraft must then drive fifteen minutes before taking off.But in aroports like Frankfurt, aircraft sometimes move very long on the ground.Are the necessary infrastructure not likely to increase the right-of-way at the airport?Alternative fuels can be mixed with krosne directly in tanks or pipelines upstream of the arrival laroport.It will certainly require specific infrastructures for electric or hydrogne aircraft but for the moment we do not yet have an example of what this represents.We can talk about it when we get more visibility.But there is still space on the current site, where they could be installed.Apart from changes in technology, the rest is not insurmountable.

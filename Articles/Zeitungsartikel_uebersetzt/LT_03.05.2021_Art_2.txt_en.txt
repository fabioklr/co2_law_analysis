Time, 03.05.2021 On the revision of the CO2 law, economic camps far from homogenous With the exception of the TCS, the oil and road lobby fights the revision of the law.Economic organizations are shared.On the left, some of the climate grvists reject the law, considering what does not go far enough Bernard Wuthrich The revision of the CO2 law opposes camps that are not homogenous.The majority of the big fatires have chosen the one who supports the new law.This committee includes Economiesuisse as well as 36 branches, such as Swiss Banking, the Swiss Company of Entrepreneurs (SSE), Swiss Textiles, the Association of Swiss Electric Enterprises (AES) or the Swiss Insurance Association (ASA).Companies are also committed to the reform: Novartis, Siemens, IKEA, BKW, Alpiq and Axpo, among others.We are not satisfied with all aspects of the law, such as the climate fund.But it is an acceptable compromise that prompts us to slip a yes of reason into lurne.It's better to act now than to wait.A refusal would imply a return of several years, justifies the director of Economiesuisse, Monika Rhl.In front of this camp stands a sling of opposition composed of other economic actors.It is led by the ptroliery and automotive industry, the notorious exception of the TCS, which decided to support the revision of the CO2 law.Opposition of the Ptrolier and Automotive Lobby The Opposition Committee brings together Avenergy (ex-Union ptrolire), Swissoil, Citec Switzerland (tanks), Ramoneur Suisse, Auto-suisse, lAstag, LACS, the Swiss Union of Automotive Professionals (UPSA), Routesuisse.The Employers' Centre and GastroSwitzerland are also part of this committee, which can count on the support of the Swiss Union of Arts and Crafts (USAM), the LUDC and some liberal-radical dissents.The new law is inefficient in terms of climate.It will at best reduce global CO2 missions by half a million.The 4000 Swiss companies, including the Employers' Centre, which have concluded target agreements with the Energy Agency for the Economy have achieved impressive results in terms of climate and energy efficiency, counter-arguments the director of the Employers' Centre, Christophe Reymond.He sees in the commitment of Economysuisse a will to repaint himself in green.The romantic climate Grve movements are also fighting the new law, considering that it does not go far enough.

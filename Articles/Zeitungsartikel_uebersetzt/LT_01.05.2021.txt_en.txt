Le Temps, 01.05.2021 In Switzerland, aviation weighs heavily on the climate TRANSPORT The air sector contributes significantly to climate warming, particularly in a country of great travellers like Switzerland.A tax on plane tickets could be introduced under the CO2 law PASCALINE MINET @pascalineminet Are you hit by the shame of flying because of its impacts on the climate, or flygskam as they say in the South, where this phnomne is common?Or, on the contrary, do you want to jump in the first flight that came, so that the restrictions on Covid-19's Pandmie will be relaxed?To help you make your idea, we propose to dive into the figures of the climate impact of aviation.New knowledge is prompting him to reconsider the increase.The subject is likely to be debated in the coming weeks, because in June the vote will be held on the revision of the CO2 law, which provides for the introduction of a text on plane tickets.The climate balance of aviation varies greatly according to the geographical perspective adopted.It is estimated that 23% of global missions are responsible, or a relatively small share of the problem.But it is important to know that less than 20% of the world's population has already flown and that this proportion is leading to rapid progress, says Yves Chatton of the Association Transport et Environnement (ATE).A small number of very diligent travellers A minority of travellers around the world is thus responsible for the majority of aviation missions.After a study published in 2020 in Global Environmental Change, only 34% of the world's population made one or more international flights in 2018.The busiest travellers, 1% of the world's population, are believed to be the origin of half of aviation missions.The data on the distribution of air transport remain sparse, but there is evidence that some countries and individuals contribute disproportionately to the missions of air transport, the authors say.However, Switzerland is one of the countries where there is a lot of flying.On the basis of Our World in Data, in 2018, international aviation missions averaged 523 kg of CO2 per person in Switzerland.A figure in some island states, but everything is twice as high as its neighbours, France and Germany, for example.Such missions are quickly reached: a traveller returning from Genve Madrid to economic class puts 430 kg of CO2 equivalents, according to the estimates of the Myclimate carbon compensation site.Each person making a round trip from Genve New York to the same class puts about 2 tons.Unfortunately, from a climate point of view, these missions are nothing danecdotal.According to the Swiss Environment Report 2018 of the Federal Office for the Environment (OFEV), each person should put up to 600 kg of CO2 per year, to have one in two chances of containing the increase in temperatures below 2 degrs by the end of the shekel, as foreseen by the Paris Agreement.However, in 2015, the Swiss put on average 14 tons of CO2 equivalent, 23 times more than the amount does not exceed But let's go back to the aviation missions in Switzerland.What is their climate impact in relation to other sectors of the country?The answer is not easy to find.According to the OFEV greenhouse gas inventory, the transport sector accounts for the largest share of total greenhouse gas missions (32.4%), followed by the industry sector with 24.3% and the building sector with 24.2%.In addition to CO2, other heating substances Only Hic, international transport is not included in this inventory, as it is not included in the Paris Agreement.Domestic flights constitute only a congruous portion (0.12 million tonnes of CO2 per year) of total aviation missions, compared to international flights (5.74 million tonnes per year, counting only flights from Swiss airports).Adding these two types of flights together, the aviation sector accounts for about 11% of Switzerland's total greenhouse gas missions.Is already much more than the 2 3% at world level.However, these estimates are still in the midst of the impact of aviation.They are based solely on the CO2 missions of aircraft, although it is now known that most of their warming effect comes from other substances.In addition to CO2, aircraft also carry deau steam and nitrogen oxides.Steam deau forms in condensation tranes and later in the form of cirrus.Their warming effect is about two-thirds greater than that of CO2.Nitrogen oxides have various effects on the concentration of mthan and ozone, greenhouse gases.Their warming effect is about half that of CO2.It is also necessary to count the cooling effect of sulphur dioxide put by aircraft.When considered as a whole, the total warming effect of aviation is about 3 times that of CO2 alone, dilute the climatologist Urs Neu, of the Swiss Academy of Natural Sciences SNAT, author of a recent report on the impact of air transport on the climate.Taking account of these non-CO2 missions therefore makes the already dirty climate note of aviation strongly rise.If we use this multiplier of 3, then we can estimate that aviation actually corresponds to 27% of Switzerland's climate impact, making it the country's main emitter.This should better invite us to take it into account in policies to combat warming, says Yves Chatton of the ATE.Some estimates are slightly less.The CO2 Ordinance, currently in consultation, provides for a 2.5 multiplier to be applied to quantify the climate impact of flights.This value will have to be indicated on the plane tickets to inform the traveller.While the overall effect of aviation on warming is therefore still under discussion, the fact that this sector must contribute to the fight against climate change is not called into question by anyone.I cannot say that all trips made from our airport are made 100% in a sustainable spirit.But it seems to me wrong to focus solely on the volume of air travel.The objective must be to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of flights.The industry is working on projects for new engines and alternative fuels, with the aim of achieving aviation carbon neutrality in 2050, says Andr Schneider, Genve Aroport's director.If the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the Federal Council are to be respected, all solutions must be considered, says Urs Neu.But technical solutions, such as the use of synthetic krosne, will only be effective longer term.To reduce the use of aircraft appears as the simplest solution to implement quickly.As such, a tax on airline tickets could be an effective measure.This will depend on the conditions chosen.Changing our way of travel Currently, the tax is 30 francs for short-haul flights, 60 francs for medium-haul flights and 90 francs for long-haul flights, in economic class.This tax would have a double effect, as it will on the one hand encourage travellers less to fly, and on the other hand it will encourage the air sector to develop alternatives.It will be able to recover some of the taxes in the form of incentives for research and companies using alternatives will be able to sell their tickets with a reduced tax, reve Yves Chatton.Opponents argue that such a tax could result in a postponement of traffic on neighbouring aroports.Most of them (Germany, Austria, France, Italy) have, however, already introduced a tax on air traffic, whether for fiscal or environmental reasons.Beyond this tax, the current crisis could be an opportune occasion to question our way of travelling.Before the crisis of the Covid-19, a threefold increase in the demand for air transport was expected between 2020 and 2050.Experts believe that the sector should return to growth before the Pandmie around 2024 or 2025.The manner in which the traffic will resume is not yet clear.It is likely that the number of business trips will rise again.For private trips, the whole question is whether it will stay cool going shopping London for a weekend.In this field, perceptions can change very quickly, wants to believe Urs Neu.The tudes led by the air companies with their clients indicate that there is a great impatience to be able to travel again after the pandmie, tempre Andr Schneider.

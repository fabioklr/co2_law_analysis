NZZ, 01.06.2021 Financial sector enters the climate offensive Andr Mller The Swiss financial centre is moving into the fight against climate change: Every week an insurance company tightens its emission targets or praises a bank's grne investment products.This Monday, the Financial Market Supervisory Authority informed Finma that large financial institutions need to identify climate risks in the future in a transparent manner.She's running open Tren.In their reports, the big ones are already guided by the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, to which the finma is now leaning.On the same day, the WWF and the consultants from PWC presented a study on how climate-friendly the 15 largest Swiss retail banks are.Banks and insurers are in a good starting position to become part of the solution instead of the problem: they emit little CO2 themselves and have the levers to steer money flows in a climate-friendly direction.Nevertheless, they met climate change mostly defensively until the height of the climate strikes in 2019.Since then, financial companies have increasingly switched to offensive.They set themselves more ambitious goals and actively communicate them.Currently, the branches of banks and insurers are clearly committed to the CO2 law.The current activism is also smart marketing the customers mgs grne companies.However, banks and insurers are actually taking the issue more seriously and making progress.This is encouraging: the market economy can provide strong incentives for climate-friendly action if the framework is set correctly.

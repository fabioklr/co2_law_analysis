Environmental protection as a future guarantor: Five young parties promote C02 law The Swiss young parties have launched a joint vote in Bern. They place the justice of generations at the centre of their reasoning. SDA/fal Juso, Junge Mitte, Junge Grüne, Junge GLP and Junge EPP have joined forces for a yes to the CO2 law. They place the justice of generations at the centre of their argument. On Thursday, they launched their vote in front of the media in Berne. The core statement of the young parties is: "The CO2 law is a necessary step for a future that is suitable for the enkels", as stated in a communication. The law was an important step in achieving the Paris objectives and creating incentives for a sustainable economy. The CO2 Act takes urgent measures to reduce emissions in transport, the building sector and industry, the young parties argue. The climate fund and the redistribution of investment would flow back into the economy and go to the population. "Investments that are used to get away from the fossil economy for good." Behind the CO2 Act is a broad alliance of business associations, NGOs and parties. The referendum was taken against the law: on the one hand, by an economic committee with the support of the SVP, which goes too far in the law, and on the other hand by Western Swiss climate strikers who go too little far.

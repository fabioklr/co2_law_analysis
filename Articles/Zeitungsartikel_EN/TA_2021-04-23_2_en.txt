Science meddles in political debate a CO2 law Now science interferes in the voting struggle. Yesterday, more than a hundred researchers, including Switzerland's most well-known climate researchers, publicly submitted the Ja-parole for submission, about which the people on 13 July were invited to participate. ==References== In the intensified CO2 law, they see "an important step in the right direction" to achieve Switzerland's climate goal. "We left the field to lobbyists for too long," says Reto Knutti, climate researcher at ETH Zurich. The move towards politics is controversial. The more political science becomes, the more negotiable its positions could become, says political geographer Michael Hermann. Politics is divided. The researchers from those circles who support the law receive applause. There are criticisms of the opponents of the vote. (sth/lae) page 38

Readers' Mail Head Greens or Earth Greens Meinier, 28 May Will this 13th June be a lucky 13th of the Head Greens or Earth Greens? This very lively debate is a bit of a mistake! Of course everyone has his own Green. So white earthworms or almost green white glasses... Through partisan promises, all virtuous, half-full or half-empty glass? Soft green or green of grey? The Lambda citizen will catch more vertigo than green ideas... Do we want to consume local, with – almost clean – controlled? Or from – uncontrollable bio – from the whole world, added CO2? Let us continue to enjoy this beautiful and very precious world of peasantry, farmers, breeders, etc. Swiss label? Whatever our opinion, [...] let us increase the participation of these votes of June 13, lucky! Claude Roulet Air sector already penalized Confignon, 20 May The entire air sector has been struggling for more than a year due to travel restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic. Airlines are the companies that come first in everyone's minds, but airports themselves are heavily affected, as are all companies that are present at airport sites or that are indirectly dependent on the aviation world. Introducing a new CO2 tax on airline tickets will therefore penalise not only passengers (especially families), who will travel less, but also airlines and all other actors in the field. One less passenger on an airplane, in addition to the loss of profits for the carrier, is also, in terms of unsold goods: a train ticket to the airport or a taxi race, a consumption or meal before departure, a tourist guide or newspapers, a purchase at a shop and a passenger tax. This is largely enough to put a no to the CO2 law on the ballot on 13 June next. Catherine Locca

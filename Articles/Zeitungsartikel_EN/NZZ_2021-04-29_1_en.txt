The Farmers' Association says yes to the CO2 law art. · Rarely have Swiss farmers struggled as hard for a voting slogan as for those on the CO2 Act, which was adopted on 13 May. ==References====External links== The decision has now been made: the parliament of the Swiss Farmers' Association (SBV), the Chamber of Agriculture, has decided on the yes-parole. Agriculture was willing to make its contribution, the SBA informed on Wednesday. With the law, agriculture could be "part of the solution" with the production of renewable energy, for example. The members of the Chamber of Agriculture supported the law by 56 to 19 votes with 9 abstentions. Previously, the SBV board had already recommended a yes. The band initially caressed with a voice release, also for tactical reasons. On the one hand, he feared a credibility problem if he recommended that the proposal be rejected, especially since agriculture is severely affected by the effects of climate change. On the other hand, the SVP wing in the association warned against high cost consequences of the submission. If the law were adopted, agriculture would have to reduce its CO2 emissions by 20 percent by 2030 compared to 1990.

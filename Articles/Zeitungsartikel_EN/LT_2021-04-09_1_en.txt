IN BRIEF The climate, the absolute priority of young people The Youth of the PS, the Centre, the Greens, the PVL and the Evangelical Party are launching themselves in the battle for the CO2 law, in popular vote on 13 June. This is a first step in achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Several politically engaged teenagers came to Bern to the press to stress the importance of this law, which concerns all generations. "For us, climate change is an existential threat," said Eléonore-Constance Post, 16, a member of the Young Greens. The CO2 law adopted by the parliament in September is intended to enable Switzerland to reduce its CO2 emissions by 50% by 2030 compared to 1990 and to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. She was attacked in a referendum by a committee from the economy. ATS

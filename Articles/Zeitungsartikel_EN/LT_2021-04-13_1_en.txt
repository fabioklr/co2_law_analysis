Greenhouse gas emissions in slight decline ATMOSPHERE Switzerland is expected to miss its "climate target" by 2020. It is still very far away this year ATS In 2019, Switzerland emitted 46.2 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents. This is about 0.3 million tonnes less than the previous year, says the Federal Office for the Environment (OFEV) on Monday. Environmental organizations say they are "shocked" by this stagnation. Emissions are 14% lower than in the base year, 1990. According to current estimates, Switzerland is expected to miss its 2020 climate target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared to 1990. In order to significantly reduce emissions, it is essential to strengthen measures, as provided for in the CO2 law, according to OFEV. In the construction sector, emissions remained the same as in the previous year. They represent a total decrease of 34% compared to 1990. This stability, despite a colder winter, is mainly due to improved energy efficiency in buildings and the increasing replacement of oil and gas heating systems with heat pumps and renewable energies. The strong influence of winter temperatures on emissions shows that the building sector continues to heat mostly with fossil fuels, says OFEV. Taking the climate factor into account, emissions in this sector are decreasing by 0.3 million tonnes per year, which is not enough to meet its target of a 40% reduction until 2020. Transportation sector in difficulty Industry emissions also remained unchanged in 2019. Compared to 1990, the decline is 14%. These emissions have been stagnant for several years and if this trend continues, the 20% reduction target until 2020 will be missed. In the transport sector, emissions amounted to about 15 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents in 2019, as in the previous year, 1% higher than the level reached in 1990. More energy efficient vehicles emitted less CO2 per kilometre. But these positive effects are offset by the increase in the number of kilometres travelled.

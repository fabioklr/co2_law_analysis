Very small decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 According to a report by the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEV), Swiss greenhouse gas emissions decreased slightly ATS In 2019, Switzerland emitted 46.2 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents. It is about 0.3 million tonnes less than the previous year, says the Federal Office for the Environment (OFEV) on Monday, which calls for a strengthening of the measures. Emissions are 14% lower than in the 1990 reference year. According to current estimates, Switzerland is expected to miss its 2020 climate target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared to 1990. In order to significantly reduce emissions, it is essential to strengthen measures, as provided for in the CO2 law, according to OFEV. Building and Industry Stability In the construction sector, emissions remained the same as in the previous year. They represent a total decrease of 34% compared to 1990. This stability, despite a colder winter, is mainly due to improved energy efficiency in buildings and the increasing replacement of oil and gas heating systems with heat pumps and renewable energies. The strong influence of winter temperatures on emissions shows that the building sector continues to heat mostly with fossil fuels, says OFEV. Taking the climate factor into account, emissions in this sector are decreasing by 0.3 million tonnes per year, which is not enough to meet its target of a 40% reduction until 2020. Industry emissions also remained unchanged in 2019. Compared to 1990, the decline is 14%. These emissions have been stagnant for several years and if this trend continues, the 20% reduction target until 2020 will be missed. Kilometers travelled up In the transport sector, emissions amounted to about 15 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents in 2019, as in the previous year, 1% higher than the level reached in 1990. The addition of biofuels to fossil fuels has increased in recent years, reaching nearly 4% of total fuel sales in 2019. Energy-efficient vehicles also emitted less CO2 per kilometre. But these positive effects are offset by the increase in the number of kilometres travelled. If the trend continues, the transport sector will miss the target of less than 10% by 2020. Declining in agriculture Agriculture emissions have decreased slightly from 2018 to about 6.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents, about 12% less than in 1990. Synthetic greenhouse gas emissions, such as refrigerant, decreased slightly from 2018 to about 1.6 million tonnes in 2019. As of January 1, 2019, the Montreal Protocol regulates 18 significant synthetic greenhouse gases. Its implementation, also in Switzerland, is expected to lead to a sharp reduction in emissions of this type of gas. However, the Confederation is unlikely to achieve the planned reduction for other emissions by some 10% compared to 1990, until 2020, warns OFEV. The Swiss greenhouse gas inventory for the years 1990 to 2019 was submitted to the UN Secretariat on Climate Change on 12 April 2021. It provides a comprehensive picture of Switzerland's greenhouse gas emissions, which are governed by the Kyoto Protocol.

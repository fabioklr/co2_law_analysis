A sharper climate goal alone is not enough The CO2 emissions of new cars are falling. But it has to be faster. Stefan Häne The direction is right again. After three years of rising values, the new cars emitted on average less CO2 last year than in 2019: 124 grams per kilometer instead of 138. Not by chance: cars with alternative engines are more in demand than ever before. Although the industry has clearly missed the intensified climate target of 95 grams, it must therefore pay record-high buses between 100 and 200 million Swiss francs. However, 2020 marks the deepest CO2 emissions of the Swiss new car fleet. The two records show that importers can adapt to the new standard – but still too little fast. It would be wrong to blame her alone. The commitment also includes politics. It must set the framework conditions in such a way that the switch to an electric car is easily possible – not only for homeowners who can install a charging station, but also for tenants, i.e. the majority of the population. ==References====External links== In addition, the Commission is proposing to the Council that the European Parliament should be consulted on a proposal from the Commission to the Council for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the permissible sound power level of motor vehicles. The fact that the autolobby fights the law bitterly seems grotesque against this background. However, cities and municipalities are also required: they must push for the expansion of public charging stations. So far, the effort has largely failed – not least because in the red-green milieu of cities like Zurich every car is considered to be one too many, even with an alternative drive. This has to change. Otherwise, it will take far too long for the 4.7 million passenger cars in Switzerland to travel electrically.

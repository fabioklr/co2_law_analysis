Financial sector enters the climate offensive André Müller The Swiss financial centre is moving into the fight against climate change: Every week an insurance company tightens its emission targets or praises a bank for green investment products. This Monday, the Financial Market Supervisory Authority informed Finma that large financial institutions will have to identify climate risks transparently in the future. She's running in open doors. In their reports, the big ones are already guided by the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, to which the finma is now also based. On the same day, the WWF and PWC's consultants presented a study on how climate-friendly the 15 largest Swiss retail banks are. Banks and insurers are in a good starting position to become part of the solution instead of the problem: they themselves emit little CO2 and have leverage to steer money flows in a climate-friendly direction. Nevertheless, they met climate change mostly defensively until the height of the 2019 climate strikes. Since then, financial companies have increasingly switched to offensive. They set themselves more ambitious goals and actively communicate them. At present, the industry associations of banks and insurers are clearly committed to the CO2 Act. The current activism is also smart marketing – customers like "green" companies. However, banks and insurers are actually taking the issue more seriously and making progress. This is encouraging: the market economy can provide strong incentives for climate-friendly action if the framework is set correctly.

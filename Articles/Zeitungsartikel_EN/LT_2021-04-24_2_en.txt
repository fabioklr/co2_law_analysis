The unanimous Green Liberals behind the CO2 law President Jürg Grossen's party welcomes this law, which must be only an intermediate step towards climate-neutral Switzerland. ATS The delegates of the Green Liberal Party (PVL), meeting in a virtual assembly on Saturday, adopted their slogans for the votes of 13 June. They recommend the "yes" to the CO2 law, yes to the Covid-19 law, and the "no" to the "no" to the "no" to terrorism law. They had already accepted the clean drinking water initiative in February and left the right to vote on pesticides. A possible ecological turning point The CO2 law is an important intermediate step towards a climate-neutral Switzerland, but others have to follow, the Liberal Greens believe. According to them, Switzerland must take on a pioneering role in climate protection. Ecological change is possible, as the technologies and know-how to do so are available. "If we implement it properly, this law offers a great opportunity for our economy and society," said National Advisor Isabelle Chevalley (VD). The Liberal Greens have also clearly approved the Covid-19 law, which is considered particularly necessary to support businesses and self-employed economically affected by the pandemic. Through it, culture, sport and the media received the necessary support during the crisis. Rejection of the law would jeopardize support measures and create legal uncertainty. The Liberal Greens, on the other hand, swept the terrorism law from 148 votes to 11. They believe that it attacks liberal values and the rule of law by including vague formulations that open the door to arbitrary mistakes and decisions. According to them, the presumption of innocence is abolished and the principle of separation of powers is violated, since coercive measures can be ordered by the police without evidence.

The CO2 law will cost mostly the richest families Climate The popular classes will be poorly affected and the CO2 tax is social, according to one study. The new CO2 law, submitted to the people in June, will mainly affect high incomes that are not aware of the environment, not just workers and the rural population, as the opponents say, according to a study which the "SonnagsZeitung" echoed. A rich family of four who fly each year, lives in a large, poorly insulated villa and owns two expensive cars will have to bear an additional cost of 2200 francs, according to the study. A less affluent family would have to bear only 460 francs of additional costs, even if it owns a car and its small house is also poorly isolated. The study concludes that the CO2 tax would therefore be social and notes that the levies on domestic fuel oil are much larger than the levies on petrol and diesel. ATS

Rural population benefits from the new CO2 Act levies are more likely to burden urban people. ==References====External links== In addition, the Commission has adopted a proposal for a Directive on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to turnover taxes. The additional costs should be manageable for the population. According to Environment Minister Simonetta Sommaruga, a family of four, who fly on holiday once a year in Europe, drive a petrol car and heat with oil, only incur additional costs of an average of 100 francs per year. For the opponents of the law, this statement is "pure beauty". The Solothurn SVP National Councillor Christian Imark said last week that the extra burden for a family was many times higher. And: The law is unfair, because the rural population is being snarled above all. In the peripheral and mountain areas there is no dense public transport network available, which is why the population there is dependent on the car. In total, Imark expects an increase of between 600 and 900 francs per family. However, stakeholders from peripheral and mountainous regions do not agree with the SVP lamento. On the one hand, the majority of households in rural cantons do not have to pay for CO2 emissions because they do not heat with oil or natural gas. They therefore benefit from the redistribution of the steering charges. On the other hand, CO2 emissions on fuels could be prevented. Border regions should even benefit from the law – also thanks to climate funds.

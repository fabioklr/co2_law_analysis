NZZ, 01.06.2021 Chinese tourists pay for Swiss pensioners The air ticket tax cancels a redistribution to the detriment of foreign passengers David Vonplon Switzerland is a country of frequent flyers.Swiss people fly twice as frequently abroad as the inhabitants of neighbouring countries.And they fly on average more than the Americans.The new air ticket tax is intended to dampen this desire for travel.Depending on the distance, 30 to 120 Swiss francs per departure will be paid if you travel abroad from a Swiss airport.That's how it wants the new CO2 Act, on which we will be on the 13th.President. — The debate is closed.The surprising thing about the new tax mechanism is that although only half of the land is redistributed, the majority of the Swiss population benefits, according to the federal government, from the airline tax.Anyone who makes a holiday in Europe once a year by plane pays 30 francs for a short-haul flight and recovers 60 francs in the form of low-cost health insurance companies.And even people with two European refugees per year pay nothing net.One inevitably wonders: How can this bill be dealt with?Only a minority pays on it The fact that only a small minority puts on the bottom line, the research institute Sotomo pointed out that the majority of the CO2 emissions in Switzerland are accounted for by very few: for example, the top 5 percent of frequent flyers with their private wings alone are responsible for around a third of the emissions of aviation.The unequal distribution of flight behaviour has the consequence that most Swiss people would be better off financially by the levy, according to a study.But that's only half the truth.What has been suppressed so far: At the checkout are asked mainly foreign passengers who use Swiss airports.They must pay the ticket tax from Switzerland as well as persons residing in Switzerland.However, they are excluded from the distribution of funds.A look at the statistics of the international airports in this country shows how much the foreign airports contribute to the revenue from the ticket tax.Zrich Airport recorded 8.3 million passengers in the Corona year 2020.Only just 41 percent of the passengers who picked up in Kloten came from Switzerland.The rest comes from Germany (11 percent), another European country (29 percent), North America (10 percent) or the Far East (4 percent).If you pull off the foreign transit passengers who do not pay a ticket tax, the foreign passengers who take off from Zrich still account for 46 percent.Before the pandemic, the origin of the passengers showed a similar picture: in 2019, only 44 percent of the departing passengers also had their residence in Switzerland, according to surveys carried out by Zrich Airport in the case of departing passengers.In comparison with the transit passengers, the Auslndische Flugggste accounted for around 40 percent.In Basel-Mlhausen airport, close to the border, the shares of foreign and Swiss passengers paying the airline ticket tax, for example, are balanced.Geneva Airport, upon request, does not provide statistics on the nationality of its passengers.However, there is little reason to assume that the shares of Swiss and foreign passengers differ significantly from those of the other major airports in Switzerland.The bottom line is that foreign flights thus account for 40 to 50 percent of the proceeds from the ticket tax.You will pay several hundred million for the ticket fees, without even seeing one rapping of this money.This in the light of the fact that, according to the Federal Government's estimates, the planned tax on air tickets before the pandemic crisis would have brought about CHF 1.3 billion every year.Thus, a redistribution of foreign passengers to Swiss households takes place: The tourist from China pays for the pensioner from Birmensdorf, the sddeutsche Geschftsmann for the family from Mettendorf.If only people living in Switzerland were to pay the tax, the bill would also be much worse for the Swiss population: 40 percent would then keep less money at the time of the ticket tax than they paid, as calculations by Sotomo show.In addition, not only Swiss households profit indirectly from the taxes that foreign airlines pay, but also Swiss companies.After all, half of the revenue from the air ticket tax flows into the climate fund and is used to boost technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.These include loans and loans to innovative companies.These funds also support research into synthetic kerosene.Unwanted side effects If Switzerland charges the ticket tax, however, it creates an incentive to avoid the Swiss airports.According to Bettina Kunz, Spokesperson of Flughafen Zrich AG, there is a risk that some of the foreign flying stallions, such as those from neighbouring Sd German regions, will evade other airports.It takes advantage of the fact that in future a considerable part of its passengers could use the French sector of Basel-Mlhausen airport to bypass the Swiss air ticket tax.Basel-Mlhausen Airport is located on French territory, but has a Swiss and a French sector.Today, more than 90 percent of the fleet is carried out under Swiss traffic rights.However, because the French environmental tax of EUR 2 63 for a European flight (Economy class) is about one tenth of the Swiss CO2 surcharge, this could soon change.Airlines operating today under Swiss traffic rights could operate under French traffic rights without further delay and thus avoid the Swiss air ticket tax, says Claire Freudenberger, spokesperson for Basel-Mlhausen airport.If we want to prevent unsavory side effects, the environmental levies of the two countries should be harmonised.Indeed, the low-cost airline Easy Jet, on request, declares that a change in the French sector will be made when an air ticket tax is introduced.All airlines that would start there would then have a clear price advantage.

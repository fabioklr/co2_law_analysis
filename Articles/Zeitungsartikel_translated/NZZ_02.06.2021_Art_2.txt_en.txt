NZZ, 02.06.2021 Majorities in the agricultural initiatives are overturned for the CO2 law three weeks before the referendum of 13 June.In June, the agricultural initiatives lost their narrow lead: a no is emerging.The CO2 law is surprisingly tight.Thomas Schrpf In the country, the no to the agricultural initiatives is clear.Peter Klaunzer / Keystone The two agricultural initiatives show a tangible no-trend.The second SRG trend survey (by GfS) published on Wednesday, as well as the fifth opinion survey of 20 minutes and the Tamedia newspaper, also published on Wednesday, are the findings.As often with initiatives, the votes in favour increasingly moved to 'no'.==References==According to the SRG survey, the voters rejected the popular initiative for clean drinking water and healthy food by 53 percent.44 percent of respondents agree.Three percent are still in the draw.According to the Tamedia surveys, even 57 percent of respondents would reject the initiative; only 41 percent would agree.The surveys show a clear city-country grave.However, approval is much smaller even in large agglomerations.Politically, the situation is rather clear: Anxieties of left parties and the GLP are predominantly for the initiative, sympathizers of other parties and non-partisans are majority against it.The main argument of the opponents is that restrictions lead to more imported environmental damage.They also see the initiative as an existential threat to agriculture.Equally clear is the decline in the previous yes trend in the pesticide initiative.According to the SRG survey, the People's Initiative for a Switzerland without synthetic pesticides was rejected at 51 percent at the end of May.47 percent were indecisive and 2 percent indecisive.In the Tamedia survey, the no-trend is even clearer: 42 percent of respondents spoke out against the initiative for and 57 percent against the initiative, and 1 percent didn't say they wanted to vote.With the CO2 Act, the result of the CO2 Act will be just as surprising.Compared to the first SRG survey, the voter's Yes share fell by 6 percentage points to 54 percent.43 percent want to reject the law, 3 percent are still undecided.In the 20 minutes/Tamedia survey, the vote was even only 53 percent, 46 percent of respondents said no, 1 percent was undecided.The 'no' approach is particularly evident in areas where there is a shortage of resources and in the case of low to medium-sized social groups.Only the Wohlerinnen and Wahler of the SVP are clearly against the law.Their rejection even increased compared to the end of April.In the left-wing party-political spectrum up to the GLP - despite the no of a part of the climate strike movement - is the high approval.However, it has been broken off in the case of non-partisans who are new majority against the CO2 law.The vote has increased in favour of Whlenden in the middle.However, a majority of the FDP base, unlike their party, continues to say no.Even in the FDP, the Befrworter camp is growing: after an increase of 5 percentage points, it now comes to 41 percent.The CO? law has won approval from the boys.Meanwhile, 50 percent of the 18- to 34-year-olds say yes; in the second wave of the survey, it was only 45 percent.The support of the middle-aged voices is rather scarce.Clear Yes for Covid-19 Act In the Covid-19 Act, which was the subject of the referendum, the SRG survey shows a clear agreement with the 64 percent bill.32 percent took advantage of it, and 4 percent were in a draw.At 20 minutes/Tamedia, the yes is 69 percent and the no is 29 percent.2 percent did not provide any information.The rejection of SVP supporters and generally government-critical persons is particularly clear.Although all age groups are in favour of submission, approval increases significantly with the age of the respondents.Sattes Yes to the Terrorism Act A comfortable majority of 62 per cent would have been in the SRG survey on 22 October.==References====External links==32 percent were against it, 6 percent were still undecided.At 20 minutes/Tamedia, the vote was 63 percent, 34 percent said no, 3 percent were draw.With this template, the no-camp could increase over the entire campaign period.Nevertheless, the trend was not enough to tilt the result.In the second wave of the SRG-SSR trend survey for the vote of 13 July, the SRG-SSR was asked to take part in the first round of the SRG-SSR survey.On 18 June, the research institute gfs.bern, on behalf of the SRG, surveyed between the 18th and 26th centuries.==References==The third wave of the 20 minute Tamedia survey is based on 17193 responses from participants.==References====External links====References==

Time, 03.05.2021 CO2, the weight of the wallet The revision of the CO2 law will reward those who will use less harmful nergistic resources and will change heating or car.How much will the bill go for the others?Between supporters and opponents of the reform, the differences are deep Bernard Wuthrich The revision of the CO2 law will not be without consequences for people who will not change their heating and mobility habits.The project will reward those who take little or no plane, opt for a electric vehicle and do not heat up with fuel oil.The stakes are more marked in the priphric regions this is reflected in the first surveys.The ecological tax levied since 2008 on oil and natural gas cannot exceed 120 francs per tonne of CO2, or about 30 cents per litre.The actual amount received is 96francs per tonne of CO2, or 25 cents per litre.In order to encourage private owners to take advantage of more cological heating (heat pumps, solar, wood, biogas) and to better isolate their housing, the levy will be raised by (four) steps and a ceiling of 210 francs per tonne by 2028.At this date, the surcot in relation to today is estimated between 25 and 30 centimes per liter.Apart from the cost of the heating change, which can be subsidized.Between 30 and 120 francs per flight The CO2 tax will not be taxed on diesel and gasoline.But the price per litre the column will increase by another channel: compensation is required to import fuels, and importers can pass it on to prices.The law in force sets a maximum amount of 5 cents per litre.The additional fee paid by motorists is only 1.5 cents.The ceiling will be raised 10 cents ds 2022, then 12 ds 2025.Finally, the revision includes a tax on plane tickets.The Federal Council specified its intentions in a draft order.Depending on the categories, the increase will be 30francs (short-haul flights in economic class), 60francs (short-haul flights in premium economic class, business or first; medium-haul flights in economic class), 90francs (medium-haul flights in upper class; long-haul flights in economic class) or 120francs (long-haul flights in upper class).97francs more per family How much will it cost Swiss households?The Federal Office for the Environment (OFEV) has provided an estimate for an average family of four persons.In its calculation, it includes the redistribution of a part of the revenue from the population (two thirds of the revenue from the CO2 tax and 51% of the supplement on plane tickets, see below).LOFEV relies on various assumptions: average living space of 128 mtres carrs, consumption of 8 litres of fuel oil per mtre carr, consumption of 6 litres of fuel per 100 kmtres, average annual distance of 12?500 kmtres.He concludes that a family that will not change their way of life will pay 164 francs a year to warm up and 53francs a year to travel by car.If it makes only one plane trip per year, this household will benefit from the redistribution of the revenue from the air tax at a rate of 120 francs per year.In the end, it will pay 97 net more than today.It's the Balivernes cinma, retort the opponents.Administration figures mislead, in particular the living space taken into account.In a family home in the countryside, the living space is very much larger, according to the National Councillor Christian Imark (UDC/SO), who does not manage his efforts or his medieval appearances to demolerate the arguments of the Federal Council.It is based on other rfrences: consumption of 8 litres per 100 kilometres, annual distance of 20?000 kilometres.And each time it retains the maximum amounts defined in the law, for both fuels and fuels.Isn't that exagr?Not at all.It's not a horror scenario.Simonetta Sommaruga also said that the maximum amounts would be applied.His bill of about 100 francs, that's cinma, he answers.His extrapolation gives a ten-fold superior result: a family of four could earn 1000 francs a year after a partial discount, he says.Time to Change Habits The Infras office extrapolated the financial consequences of the reform for households in 2018.SonntagsZeitung has updated these data.She concludes that a wealthy family with an apartment of 230 mtres carrs and two big cars and who travels several times a year by plane will be able to pay up to 2200francs more.A middle-class family that makes four short flights each year, heats up with fuel oil and keeps a car will pay another 470 francs by 2030.On the other hand, this family will be reimbursed 580francs if it adopts an exemplary climatic behavior: no car, no plane, cological heating.In the end, it is a question of mentality: the people who produce CO2 will pay, it is true, a little more.This is the time to change his habits, argues counselor Damian Missr (PLR/LU), a supporter of reform.He's judging Simonetta Sommaruga's numbers to be credible.By dividing them by twelve, the monthly surcot for a family of four is 8.30francs, this is thanks to the clever repayment system provided, he says.We'll see on June 13th that will have the most convincing.

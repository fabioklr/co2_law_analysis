NZZ, 02.06.2021 CO2 law: Well meant is not well done Guest commentary by Alain Schwald and Lukas Robers The global climate is growing, and we will all suffer from it.Reason enough to take effective and effective countermeasures.But the largely undisputed finding that something needs to be done is far from a conclusion on what should be done in concrete terms.Since climate change is a global problem, everyone has to tackle it; the Paris Agreement has tried to do so.However, it is becoming apparent that many countries will no longer adhere to it before or later.If two out of three people worldwide live from less than $15 a day that is over 5 billion people, then their top priority is not the global climate in 50 years.They want to raise their levels of life, which is equivalent to higher energy consumption.They will take this energy from the most favourable sources.This will lead to more greenhouse gas emissions, unless the abandonment of fossil fuels has concrete advantages.So the alternatives have to be cheaper.But that's exactly what the CO2 law fails.It consists of rules, prohibitions, levies and taxes that no country will afford as long as there are people in poverty there.For Switzerland, this means two things: firstly, it must fulfil its obligations, as efficient as possible, so that rich countries can take Switzerland as their model.==References====External links==CO2 trade and not achieved by regulation, virtually all national economies agree.It is important that the savings are made where they are the most economical.A market does this much better than politicians who decide which technology they like best.The transport and building sector should be started.In the medium term, Switzerland had to try to join the European emissions trading system and to extend it to all sectors of the economy.Secondly, every effort must be made to make the alternatives so flexible and robust that the use of fossil fuels is no longer worthwhile.This requires far greater investment in research and development.While a certain part of the climate fund is provided for, the approach is wrong because politicians and civil servants decide what is to be encouraged.Instead, Switzerland has to create framework conditions and incentives that encourage private actors to increase research and development in the field of climate-friendly technologies.In order to increase the chances of a breakthrough, the budget share for research on climate change needs to be increased.This money should be made available directly to universities and research institutes.If better framework conditions for research and development do not succeed, all efforts will ultimately be useless.Because with a share of global emissions of 0.1 percent, Switzerland can save as much as it wants without imitators.The proposed CO2 Act, on the other hand, does not create an efficient system for the pricing of greenhouse gases, nor does it contain sufficiently strong incentives for innovation.Although the CO2 emissions can be reduced a little by the law, only by too high costs and with the exclusion of the international component.Therefore, the law should be fundamentally revised and improved.Switzerland, with its possibilities, would have the responsibility to develop solutions that not only calm your conscience, but which are so good that they can serve as a model for other countries.Because when it gets too hot at some point, it is no longer fun to sunbathe in your own success.Alain Schwald and Lukas Robers are members of the Liberal Committee for Effective Environmental Policy.

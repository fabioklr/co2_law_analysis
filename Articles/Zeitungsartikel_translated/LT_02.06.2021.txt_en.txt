Le Temps, 01.06.2021 Cological projects are losing speed The second survey conducted by the gfs.bern institute for SSR shows the failure of the two pesticide initiatives.The CO2 law also loses its support.As for the Covid-19 law and the anti-terrorist measures law, they would be accepted more than 60% Bernard Wuthrich, Bern The three environmental objects submitted to the popular verdict on 13 June saw their supporters melt.The latest survey conducted by the Gfs.bern Institute for the SSR shows 54% favourable views for the CO2 law, but only 47% for the initiative for the ban on synthetic pesticides (compared with 51% no) and 44% for the initiative for clean drinking water (compared with 53% ds approval).The two initiatives are expected to be rejected on 13 June, but the authors of the investigation are finding a trend towards the non-proposal of the climate law.The last ten days of the campaign will be tense.The decline of the supporters of the three projects compared to the previous survey is substantial: it is -10 points for the clean water initiative, -8 points for the pesticide initiative and -6 points for the CO2 law.Conversely, the camp of those who say no this climate project has strengthened: it has progressed by 8 points (43%) in a month.The social consensus has broken Unsurprisingly, the foss between the cities and the countryside has grown even further.The survey also shows that the middle and disadvantaged social strata are less and less convinced by the new climate law because of the risk of increasing heating costs and car trips.This tends to weaken Simonetta Sommaruga's argument that this reform would be social because of the mechanism of reimbursement of taxes through health insurance.Politically, the left-wing and central readers still support the reform, that of the UDC rejects it and that of the PLR remains divided.gfs.bern notes a significant change in the self-employed, who seem to switch into the no camp.If the yes retains the overall advantage for the time being, the outcome of the election is more uncertain than ever, as the broad social consensus that surrounds the people of the CO2 law has broken.The no dominates both initiatives The fate of the two environmental initiatives, however, seems to seal, according to the survey institute.The non now dominates both campaigns and, as a popular initiative requires the double majority of the people and cantons, a reversal of trend is termed imaginable punishment.For the clean water initiative, the authors of the survey note that the only argument for totally cological agricultural production is no longer sufficient.Risks of import pollution, price increases and threats to the economic existence of agriculture are the main reasons for the risk that the pesticide initiative will be overtaken.gfs.bern does not exclude a final turnaround, but this would not correspond to the normal evolution of popular initiatives.Covid Act and approved anti-terrorism measures The last two objects still have a positive majority of more than 60%.Despite the mobilization of all azimuts and through all possible channels of opponents the Covid-19 law, it can always count on strong support.It is 64%, 3 less than in April.The no however won 5 points, passing 32%.The opposition is limited to the UDC electorate and to those who are wary of the government.The need to have a legal basis to act as a target and rapid manoeuvring throughout the pandmie and to cushion its economic consequences reduces the greatest number.The arguments of mfiance and defiance of the opponents struggle to fly, such a point as gfs.bern doubts a possible reversal of trend by 13 June.As for the Law on Police Measures to Combat Terrorism, it was also moving towards approval.A 62% majority, down 5 points compared to April, supports it, while the no is passed by 24% 32%.The need to provide police forces with more powerful instruments to combat terrorism is the argument most often invoked by people who will slip a yes into the ballot box.The main counter-argument for the rejection of this project is the risk of human rights violations and deprivation of liberty.But it seems to weigh less heavily on public opinion.This second capture of temperature was carried out by the institute gfs.bern for the SSR between 18 and 27 May 2021 after 17959 voting rights holders.The margin of error is about 2.8%.

NZZ, 03.05.2021 Can I use the new CO2 law to replace my old heating system 1:1?When the heating runs out, Hausigentmer likes to use the desired l- or gas heating back when replacing it.However, the new CO2 law makes the requirements much stricter.Long-term planning will be worthwhile.Christof Forster, Bern Delivery of Heidel by tanker truck: The new CO2 law will further reduce demand.Gaetan Bally / Keystone Now quickly replace the heating before the CO2 law comes into force: With such advertising, heating installers are currently trying to convince homeowners to replace their old lburner with a new one.Heating is a comparatively common option if only the initial investment is considered.But the rush is really indicated: Can homeowners with a yes on the 13th.June to the revised CO2 Act soon no more burners installed?There are 2.3 million properties in Switzerland, of which three quarters are residential buildings.The buildings account for a quarter of Switzerland's greenhouse gas emissions.Since 1990, there has been a decline in output, even in absolute terms, with 2 million more inhabitants and an increase in housing.Nevertheless, there is still a great potential for CO2 reduction in the building sector.Parliament therefore also applies the new CO2 law to real estate.From 2023, a greenhouse gas limit will apply for buildings.Per square meter of living space per year, the emission must not exceed 20 kilograms of CO2.Every five years the value drops by 5 kilograms.Cantons that have already revised their energy laws can postpone the new limit values by 2026.This is expected to be around 20 cantons on the date of the closing date at the beginning of 2022.Strict set in the CO2 Act This is a strict set.Thomas Ammann of the Hausigentmerverband says that three quarters of the residential buildings do not reach the value.If you want to keep heating with l, you have to renovate your building.However, it is not enough to simply change the windows.In addition to the windows, the outside walls and the roof must be energetically renovated, says Olivier Brenner of the conference of cantonal energy directors.There's a quick charge of 100000 francs.However, Hauseigentmer can also switch to a renewable heating system.Popular are heat pumps.Other alternatives are wood heaters or the connection to a remote heat grid.Although such heating systems are more expensive than l- or gas heating, they are more favourable than the overall renovation of the house.Definitely no longer mg will be the 1:1 replacement of an lheat 2033.The limit value is 10 kilograms CO2 per square meter.This does not comply with the best insulation even with an l-heater.He who heats with gas has a little more time.Gas heaters emit a quarter less CO2 than lburners.But even with gas, a 1:1 replacement of the heating from 2028 is only possible if the house is extensively renovated.The new CO2 law is a step towards net zero, which the Federal Council wants to achieve in 2050.This is not available for free, says Marianne Znd of the Federal Office for Energy.Homeowners rt them to start planning renovations early, to tap them and to put money aside.In many cantons, there is funding for the energy renovation and installation of a renewable heating system.As a rule, the cantons contribute around 10 percent of the investment costs.In Freiburg only very few heatings are left Many cantons have already created facts before the vote.Currently, 13 cantons have restricted energy regulations for buildings.They are based on the model regulations of the cantons in the energy sector.In 2014, the cantons agreed to strongly harmonise the cantonal energy targets.Some cantons such as Bern, Aargau and Solothurn must take a new start because their implementation templates failed on the urn.But in other cantons the climate strike movement brought momentum into the matter, angry energy directors took courage and took their pennant templates out of the drawers.In the canton of Freiburg, the revised Energy Act has led to an astonishing change of behaviour.In 2020, in the first year after entry into force, only 18 of 617 l heaters were replaced with the same technology.This corresponds to 3 percent.In 82 percent of the cases, homeowners opted for a heat pump.The rest bet on farworms or wood firing.In other cantons a similar development can be observed.With the new heaters the loss between fossil and renewable has turned around.In the cantons with the new regulations, renewable heating systems have become standard.New buildings are practically only heated with renewable systems.It is interesting to note that this development has taken place, although cantonal regulations go less far than the national limit set by the new CO2 Act.In 2014, the cantons agreed that renewables will cover at least 10 percent of the energy demand in the case of a heating replacement.This corresponds to the half of the heat requirement for hot water.Some cantons go beyond that.The steering levy strengthens the effect Apparently, the minimum requirement was an important driver of the switch to renewable energies.Many owners who now have to deal with the topic come to the decision: then I make a sustainable solution, says Brenner.For example, cantonal regulations are often far exceeded because many homeowners opt for renewable energy sources at the same time.Brenner also says that such heating systems are more favourable after extraction of frederbeitren and considering the increasing CO2 emissions over the entire life cycle.Here, too, the law sets out to promote the switch to renewable energy: with the increase of the levy on fuels.The premium can rise from today's 96 francs to a maximum of 210 francs per tonne of CO2.Converted to the litre of Heizl, this results in a maximum surcharge of 55 instead of 25 centimetres.According to the Federal Government, the levy is demonstrably contributing to the trend of falling emissions of fuels.For today's heh, the share of the final price is between 20 and 30 percent, or between 10 and 20 percent for natural gas.The gradual increase will increase the steering effect.The maximum rate for a smaller single-family house with 140 square meters of residential area and a consumption of 21 liters of heating per square meter per year would be an additional charge of around 900 francs per year.Two thirds of the levy is distributed back to households.Mortgages for retired people The Hausigentmerverband rejects the new CO2 law.Many homeowners could not afford the renovation measures resulting from a heating replacement, says Ammann.In many cases, switching to air-water heat pumps is not useful.In poorly insulated buildings, heat pumps are hidden power heaters.In addition, according to Ammann, older homeowners often no longer want to deal with a complex renovation.If you receive a modest pension, you often do not want or can not increase the mortgage.In such cases, the new climate fund of the Federal Banks could hedge against risks.Talks with cantonal banks have shown that retired people have certainly had access to bank loans for clinical rehabilitation, says Brenner of the Energy Directors' Conference.As long as it was more difficult, there were objects located in peripheral locations, for example, in places with strong emigration.Despite the honourable appeasements: Some homeowners are obviously under stress in the CO2 law.If it is assumed, there will be a temporary increase in heating costs.This experience was experienced by various cantons before the entry into force of their new energy regulations.Such an effect cannot be prevented, says Brenner.In any case, the advertising of the industry will be resonant with some household owners.
